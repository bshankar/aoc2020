This repository is built upon:

  1. [[https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc][cargo-aoc]]:  a CLI tool for automated input downloading, running and benchmarking the solutions.
  2. [[https://github.com/servo/rust-fnv][rust-fnv]]: Fowler–Noll–Vo hash function which is faster than standard `HashSet`, `HashMap` for smaller inputs.
  3. [[https://github.com/frozenlib/parse-display][parse-display]]: A simple procedural macro for parsing strings 
     
* Usage

#+begin_src sh
$ cargo aoc input [-d <day>]  # fetch input
$ cargo aoc [-d <day>]  # Run solutions for a day
$ cargo aoc bench -o  # Benchmark and open the results
#+end_src
